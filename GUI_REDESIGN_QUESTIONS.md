# SlideMan GUI Redesign: Critical UX Questions

## Current Problem Analysis
The current GUI suffers from fundamental UX issues:
- **Disconnected pages** - each feels like a separate application
- **Unclear user journey** - no obvious path from "I have files" to "I built a presentation"  
- **Poor information scent** - users can't predict what clicking will do
- **Fragmented workflows** - related tasks split across different pages
- **No workflow guidance** - users left to figure out the "right" way to use the app

## Essential Questions for GUI Redesign

### 1. User Mental Models & Goals
- **What is the user's primary mental model?** Do they think "file manager" or "project workspace" or "presentation builder"?
- **What are the 3 core user goals?** (e.g., organize slides, find content, build presentations)
- **What's the user's typical workflow?** Step-by-step from import to export
- **What analogies resonate?** (iTunes library, photo organizer, code editor, etc.)
- **Where do users get confused first?** What's the biggest "where do I start?" moment?

### 2. Information Architecture 
- **Should this be project-centric or slide-centric?** Which is the primary organizing principle?
- **What's the information hierarchy?** Projects > Files > Slides > Elements? Or different?
- **How do keywords fit into the mental model?** Are they metadata, navigation, or primary organization?
- **Should Assembly be a separate "mode" or integrated into browsing?**
- **What belongs together spatially?** Which functions need to be visible simultaneously?

### 3. Core Workflow Analysis
- **What's the "happy path"?** The ideal 5-step user journey from start to finish
- **Where are the workflow breakpoints?** What causes users to lose context or momentum?
- **What tasks need to flow together seamlessly?** Browse → Tag → Add to Assembly → Export?
- **Where do users need to switch contexts?** When is it OK to go to a "different place"?
- **What should be persistent across all views?** (Search box? Assembly basket? Current project indicator?)

### 4. Navigation & Page Structure
- **Should this be single-page with panels or multi-page with navigation?**
- **What needs always-visible access?** Search, current project, assembly basket?
- **How should users move between related tasks?** Tabs, sidebars, inline transitions?
- **What's the primary navigation metaphor?** Workspace tabs, wizard steps, dashboard tiles?
- **How do users know where they are and how to get back?**

### 5. Content Discovery & Organization
- **How should users browse slides?** Grid, list, filtered views, faceted search?
- **What makes finding content intuitive?** Visual browsing, text search, faceted filters?
- **How should search and browse integrate?** Same interface or separate modes?
- **What preview information is essential?** Thumbnails, metadata, context?
- **How should tagging feel?** Like file properties, social media tags, or something else?

### 6. Assembly & Creation Workflow
- **Should Assembly be a "shopping cart" or a "workspace"?**
- **How do users understand what's in their assembly?** Always visible panel, dedicated view, or indicator?
- **What's the relationship between browsing and assembling?** Seamless or distinct modes?
- **How should slide reordering work?** Drag-drop, list manipulation, visual timeline?
- **When should users see the "presentation preview"?** During assembly or separate step?

### 7. Progressive Disclosure & Complexity
- **What features should beginners see first?** What can be hidden initially?
- **How do we guide new users through their first successful workflow?**
- **What's the difference between novice and expert interfaces?** More features or different workflow?
- **Which power features need expert-level access?** Bulk operations, advanced search, etc.
- **How do users graduate from beginner to power user?**

### 8. Context & State Management
- **How do users know what project they're working in?** Always visible indicator?
- **What context needs to persist across pages?** Current project, search filters, assembly state?
- **How should users switch between projects?** Dropdown, separate window, workspace tabs?
- **What happens when users lose context?** How do they recover?
- **How should recently accessed content be surfaced?**

### 9. Feedback & Understanding
- **How do users know when operations are complete?** Import, conversion, tagging, assembly
- **What operations need progress indication?** Which can be invisible?
- **How do users understand the system state?** What's been processed, what's ready, what's broken?
- **What error states need special handling?** Missing files, failed conversions, etc.
- **How do users know when they've "finished" a task?**

### 10. Integration & Handoffs
- **How should this integrate with users' existing workflows?** File system, PowerPoint, etc.
- **What import experience sets users up for success?** Guided onboarding vs. dump files and figure it out?
- **How should export/delivery work?** Save files, share links, direct to PowerPoint?
- **What happens when users need to "leave" the app?** Clear exit points vs. try to keep them in-app?

## Key Design Principles to Validate
1. **Does the interface match the user's mental model of their task?**
2. **Can users predict what will happen before they click?**
3. **Is the path to success obvious and unambiguous?**
4. **Do related tasks flow together without losing context?**
5. **Can users easily recover from mistakes or dead ends?**
6. **Does the interface scale from simple to complex usage?**

## Success Metrics for New Design
- **Time to first successful presentation** (from app launch to exported deck)
- **Task completion confidence** (do users feel they did it "right"?)
- **Feature discovery rate** (do users find the features they need?)
- **Context maintenance** (do users lose track of where they are or what they're doing?)
- **Workflow satisfaction** (does the process feel logical and efficient?)

**The goal is not just to make it look better, but to make it feel right - where users think "of course it works this way" rather than "how does this work?"**
