‚óè To transform this vision into reality, I need to understand your specific requirements and constraints. Here's what I need from you:

  üß† AI Integration Core

  1. AI Model & Infrastructure
  - Which AI service? (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Azure OpenAI, local model?)
  - Do you have API keys/access already?
  - Budget constraints? (API calls can add up)
  - Latency requirements? (Real-time vs. few seconds delay OK?)

  2. Privacy & Security
  - Can slide content be sent to external AI? (Some companies prohibit this)
  - Should AI work offline?
  - Data retention policies?
  - Need for on-premise/local AI option?

  üéØ Feature Prioritization

  3. Core AI Capabilities - Rank these 1-5:
  [ ] Natural language search ("Find slides about Q4 revenue")
  [ ] Presentation building ("Create a 10-min investor pitch")
  [ ] Content analysis ("What's missing from this deck?")
  [ ] Style suggestions ("Make this more professional")
  [ ] Real-time assistance (watching as you build)

  4. Interaction Preferences
  - Text-only or voice input too?
  - Should AI be always visible or toggle-able?
  - Proactive suggestions or wait to be asked?
  - How "chatty" should it be? (Minimal vs. conversational)

  üé® Design & Personality

  5. AI Presence
  - Avatar style? (Abstract orb, character, minimal indicator)
  - Personality traits? (Professional, friendly, creative, analytical)
  - Should it have a name?
  - Gender-neutral or specific presentation?

  6. Visual Integration
  - Where in the UI? (Right panel, floating, bottom chat-style?)
  - How much screen space can it use?
  - Transparency/overlay vs. dedicated panel?

  üîß Technical Boundaries

  7. AI Permissions
  - Read-only (just suggestions) or can modify content?
  - Can it trigger actions? (export, rearrange slides)
  - Access to file system? (import new files)
  - Integration with PowerPoint directly?

  8. Performance & Scale
  - How many slides typically in a project? (10s, 100s, 1000s?)
  - Response time expectations?
  - Multiple simultaneous users?
  - Caching AI responses?

  üìä Data & Learning

  9. Personalization
  - Should AI learn user preferences over time?
  - Store conversation history?
  - Share learning across projects or keep isolated?
  - Anonymous usage analytics?

  10. MVP vs. Future
  - What's the ONE killer AI feature for launch?
  - What can wait for v2?
  - Timeline for MVP?

  üéØ Quick Decision Framework

  If you had to choose only 3 AI features for MVP:

  A) The Assistant - Helps find and organize slides
  "Show me all slides about product features"
  "Group these by topic"

  B) The Builder - Creates presentations from prompts
  "Build a 15-minute sales pitch for enterprise clients"
  "Add competitive analysis section"

  C) The Critic - Analyzes and improves presentations
  "What's wrong with this flow?"
  "Make this more persuasive"

  D) The Designer - Ensures visual consistency
  "Fix formatting inconsistencies"
  "Apply our brand style"

  üí° One More Thing

  Your Dream Scenario:
  Describe in 2-3 sentences how you imagine a user's "perfect session" with SlideMan + AI. What would make them say "WOW"?

  ---
  Based on your answers, I can:
  1. Design the technical architecture
  2. Create the UI/UX integration plan
  3. Build a phased implementation roadmap
  4. Start coding the MVP
