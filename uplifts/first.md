mprovement Suggestions:
1. Enhanced Layout & Navigation
Add visual indicators for the active navigation item (highlight, left border, or icon change)
Use icons alongside text in the navigation menu to improve recognition
Consider using subtle hover effects for interactive elements
2. Visual Styling
Implement a more sophisticated color palette with a primary accent color (perhaps a blue or teal shade)
Add subtle gradients or shadows to create depth between UI layers
Introduce card-based elements for content areas with slight elevation effects
Use rounded corners for UI elements to create a more modern feel
3. Content Organization
Add a welcome dashboard that displays recent projects or slides when the app opens
Include thumbnails of slides in the main area instead of showing empty space
Implement a grid layout for slide thumbnails with proper spacing and borders
4. Visual Identity
Create a proper logo or icon for the app header
Add a subtle branded background pattern or texture to empty areas
Use consistent typography that enhances readability (consider font pairings)
5. Functionality Improvements
Add a quick-action toolbar beneath the menu bar for common operations
Implement a search function with a visible search box
Include a status area showing project statistics or slide counts
