## üö® CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
The current tutorial **MUST BE COMPLETELY OVERHAULED** before any student uses it. The failure rate would be 100% if students attempted to follow the current version.

### 2. TECHNOLOGY STACK CORRECTION
**REMOVE** all React.js references and **REPLACE** with HTML/CSS/JavaScript + Electron implementation as specified in the architectural documents.

### 3. FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
Focus on implementing the complete feature set from fnf_checklist.md in the following order:
1. **Core SlideMan features** (workspace functionality)
2. **PrezI AI features** (intelligent automation)
3. **User experience features** (onboarding and polish)
4. **Platform integration** (desktop and performance)

### 4. TUTORIAL AUTHOR ACCOUNTABILITY
The tutorial author must **personally verify** that every code example works and that following the tutorial produces a functional PrezI application. No shortcuts or assumptions can be made.

### 5. VALIDATION PROCESS
Before release, the tutorial must be:
- [ ] Tested by an independent reviewer on a clean system
- [ ] Validated against all specification documents
- [ ] Verified to produce a working PrezI application
- [ ] Confirmed to meet all learning objectives

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS (POST-AMENDMENT)

### Mandatory Outcomes
After following the amended tutorial, students MUST be able to:
1. **‚úÖ Launch PrezI** - Desktop application starts without errors
2. **‚úÖ Import PowerPoint files** - COM automation works correctly
3. **‚úÖ Use AI features** - OpenAI integration functions properly
4. **‚úÖ Search and organize slides** - Library management is functional
5. **‚úÖ Create presentations** - Assembly and export work correctly
6. **‚úÖ Deploy the application** - CI/CD pipeline produces installable app

### Quality Standards
The final application must:
- **‚úÖ Match design specifications** from UXUID.md exactly
- **‚úÖ Implement all features** from fnf_checklist.md completely
- **‚úÖ Follow architectural patterns** from SAD.md precisely
- **‚úÖ Meet performance requirements** from technical specifications
- **‚úÖ Pass comprehensive test suite** with >90% coverage

**CONCLUSION: The current tutorial is a critical failure that must be completely rebuilt to ensure student success. The amendment checklist above provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating a tutorial that actually delivers on the promise of building a functional PrezI application.**

**Failure to implement these amendments will result in 100% student failure rate and complete tutorial objective failure.**
