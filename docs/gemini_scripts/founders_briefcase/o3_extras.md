Below are fresh, reasonably-scoped additions that would **delight first-time users, keep power-users loyal, and shore-up trust**—without derailing the existing Windows-first MVP schedule.  I’ve grouped them by the “feel” they enhance.

### Why these first?

1. **Minimal surface area changes** – most hook into existing agent-orchestrated flow; little architectural upheaval.
2. **High user-perceived value** – live previews, brand snap, reliable undo feel “next-gen” even if technically modest.
3. **Future multipliers** – telemetry, rating loop, marketplace seed data that improve models and community buy-in over time.

### Implementation tips

* **Leverage the existing state-machine**: add new states like `A11yCheckPending` or `BrandSnapInit` rather than bolting on ad-hoc dialogs.
* **Use feature flags** so beta testers can trial Offline Mode & Accessibility Linter without gating the entire release.
* **Bundle the hotkey listener inside your Electron shell**; map it to the existing “generateSlide” IPC call—no new backend endpoint needed.

Pick 3-4 of the *Easy/Medium* items for the next sprint to give your MVP a “wow” factor while the heavier Offline/A11y work runs in parallel.
