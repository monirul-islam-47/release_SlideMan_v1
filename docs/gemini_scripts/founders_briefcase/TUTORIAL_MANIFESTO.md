## 🧠 CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AI TUTORIAL AUTHOR

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

#### **1. Always Reference Source Documents**
- **NEVER make assumptions** about PrezI features or requirements
- **ALWAYS verify** against the specification documents before writing tutorial content
- **CROSS-REFERENCE** multiple documents to ensure accuracy
- **PRIORITIZE** CONSOLIDATED_FOUNDERS_BRIEFCASE.md as the primary source

#### **2. Build the REAL PrezI Application**
- **NOT a generic project management tool**
- **NOT a simple CRUD application**
- **YES to PowerPoint integration, AI analysis, and slide management**
- **YES to the complete feature set specified in fnf_checklist.md**

#### **3. Ensure Student Success Through Tutorial Quality**
- **Every code example must work** when students follow instructions
- **Every dependency must be documented** with exact versions
- **Every setup step must be tested** on a clean environment
- **Troubleshooting sections must be comprehensive**

#### **4. Maintain Professional Standards**
- **Industry-standard practices only** - no academic shortcuts
- **Real-world tools and workflows** used by professional developers
- **Production-quality code** with proper error handling and logging
- **Comprehensive testing** at all levels (unit, integration, E2E)

#### **5. Progressive Complexity with Safety Nets**
- **Start simple, build complexity gradually**
- **Each chapter builds on previous chapters**
- **Students always have working code** at the end of each chapter
- **Provide rollback instructions** when introducing complex features

### Verification Checklist for Tutorial Content

Before publishing any tutorial chapter, verify:
- [ ] **Feature accuracy** - Does this match the specifications?
- [ ] **Code functionality** - Does this code actually work?
- [ ] **Dependency clarity** - Are all requirements clearly stated?
- [ ] **Step completeness** - Can a student follow these instructions successfully?
- [ ] **Error handling** - What happens if something goes wrong?
- [ ] **Testing integration** - Are TDD principles properly applied?
- [ ] **CI/CD alignment** - Does this integrate with automated pipelines?

This tutorial exists to guarantee student success in building a complete, functional PrezI application. The tutorial author accepts full responsibility for student outcomes and commits to:

- **Providing clear, tested, step-by-step instructions**
- **Ensuring all code examples work as written**
- **Documenting all dependencies and requirements**
- **Creating comprehensive troubleshooting guides**
- **Maintaining alignment with all specification documents**
- **Delivering a tutorial that produces working software**

### Success Measurement
Tutorial success is measured by **ONE METRIC ONLY**:
> **Can students successfully build and run the complete PrezI application by following this tutorial?**

If the answer is **NO**, the tutorial has failed and must be revised until the answer is **YES**.
