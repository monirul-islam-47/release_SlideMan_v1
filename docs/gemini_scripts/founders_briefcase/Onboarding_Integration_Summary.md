## 3. Onboarding State Machine Integration

The onboarding state machine is now consistently defined across all documentation with the following states:

- `WELCOME`: Initial welcome screen with PrezI avatar introduction
- `API_SETUP`: Secure API key configuration and validation
- `FEATURE_TOUR` / `IMPORT_FIRST`: Branching paths based on user preference
- `COMMAND_BAR`: Introduction to command bar functionality
- `ASSEMBLY_PANEL`: Introduction to assembly workflow
- `GRADUATION`: Completion of onboarding with personalized recommendations

This state machine is supported by:
- Database tables for state tracking and transitions
- API endpoints for state management and content delivery
- Backend logic in `onboarding_manager.py`
- Frontend implementation in `onboarding.js`

## 4. API Key Security Implementation

Secure API key management is integrated across:
- Database table for credential status tracking
- API endpoints for validation and secure storage
- OS-native credential stores for key security
- Client-side validation UI components

## 5. Next Implementation Steps

According to the updated Development & Testing Plan, Sprint 6 should proceed with:

1. Implementing the onboarding state machine backend logic (`core/onboarding_manager.py`)
2. Creating the API endpoints in `api/v1/onboarding.py`
3. Developing welcome screens and interactive UI flows
4. Implementing the API key setup & validation UI
5. Creating the onboarding assistant with personalized guidance
6. Adding analytics tracking for onboarding completion rates

## 6. Windows-First Implementation Note

All documentation now consistently reflects the Windows-first implementation approach, particularly for the PowerPoint COM automation, while maintaining an architecture that allows for potential cross-platform expansion in the future.

This integration is now complete and consistent across all PrezI documentation. The blueprint is ready for implementation following the Development & Testing Plan.
