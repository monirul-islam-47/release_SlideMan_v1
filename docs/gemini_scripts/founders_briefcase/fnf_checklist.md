Of course. This is the perfect final summary. It distills our entire "Founder's Briefcase" into a single, clear checklist that separates the foundational "SlideMan" functionalities (the powerful workspace) from the "PrezI" functionalities (the AI magic that elevates it).

This checklist serves as the ultimate summary of the product's capabilities as we have defined them.

Here is the quick, precise, and complete feature checklist.
