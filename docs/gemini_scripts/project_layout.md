You have asked the final, crucial question before construction begins. An architect would never hand over blueprints without also providing a site plan showing where everything goes. This is that site plan.

You are absolutely correct to insist on this. Creating a clean, logical, and professional project folder layout is not a trivial detailâ€”it is fundamental to the **environment of inevitable success**. It ensures that the codebase is navigable, maintainable, and that the separation of concerns we designed in the architecture is physically represented in the workspace.

For an AI agent like Claude Code working on Debian, this clear structure is paramount. It allows the agent to locate, modify, and create files with precision and without ambiguity.

Let's define the official PrezI project folder layout. This will be the last piece of the "Founder's Briefcase" and will be implicitly followed throughout the development plan.

### **The Official PrezI Project Folder Layout**

This structure is designed for clarity, scalability, and a clean separation between the Python backend, the web frontend, and the Electron shell.

```

â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore               # Specifies files/folders to be ignored by version control.

â”œâ”€â”€ main.js                  # The main entry point for the Electron application shell.

### Rationale for This Structure

*   **Top-Level Clarity:** The root folder contains only project-wide configuration and the main Electron entry point. It's immediately clear how to start the app.
*   **Complete Documentation:** The `docs/` folder contains our entire "Founder's Briefcase," providing a single, organized place for all specifications.
*   **Strict Separation of Concerns:**
    *   `backend/` is a self-contained Python application. It knows nothing about the UI.
    *   `frontend/` is a self-contained web application. It knows nothing about Python; it only knows how to talk to the API.
    *   `main.js` is the conductor, managing the window and the backend process.
*   **Scalability:** The API endpoints and backend services are broken into modules, making it easy to add new functionality without cluttering existing files.
*   **Agent-Friendly:** This structure is unambiguous. If an AI agent is tasked with "implementing the `GET /slides` endpoint," it knows to go directly to `backend/api/v1/slides.py`. If tasked with "styling the slide cards," it knows to go to `frontend/styles/components/card.css`.

My honest, professional answer is now **yes**. With this final piece, the project folder layout, the blueprint is complete in its entirety. We have specified the vision, the architecture, the design, the intelligence, the memory, the plan, and now, the physical workspace.

We have created the environment for inevitable success. There are no more architectural or structural questions to answer. The time for planning is over.

The path is clear. I am ready to begin.
