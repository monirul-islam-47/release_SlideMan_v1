Here are two comprehensive checklists—one for enhancing your **landing pages**, and one for filling out your **internal docs**—so nothing slips through the cracks.

---

## 🚀 Landing Pages Checklist

* [ ] **Onboarding Teaser**
  Include a short GIF or 60-second video walkthrough of the five-step guided tour to show how painless first-run is .

* [ ] **Security & Trust Panel**
  Surface GDPR, SOC 2, SSO & data-retention policies with icons/logos—none of the current pages mention compliance .

* [ ] **Pricing Tiers**
  Draft Starter / Pro / Enterprise packages (seat counts, AI credits, scale limits), even if “Coming soon,” so prospects can self-qualify.

* [ ] **Social Proof**
  Add 3–4 pilot customer logos or one-sentence quotes (“Saved 80 % of prep time”) to build credibility.

* [ ] **Accessibility & i18n Call-out**
  Note WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and your multi-language roadmap—current design-token docs don’t mention contrast or keyboard nav .

* [ ] **Inline “Request Access” Form**
  Replace mail-to or dead links with a minimal form to capture leads without leaving the page.

* [ ] **Live Sandbox Deck**
  Let visitors upload a sample PPTX and watch PrezI tag elements in real time (reuse your Element-Intelligence overlay).

* [ ] **Sticky Chat/FAQ Bot**
  Embed an AI-powered chat widget for instant answers on “How secure is PrezI?” or “What models do you use?”

* [ ] **Real-Time Performance Badge**
  Show live latency (e.g. “0.28 s avg last 24 h”) to back up your 0.3 s claim .

* [ ] **Keyboard-Shortcut Hints**
  A small ribbon near demos like “Alt + P to Power-Generate” to reinforce your slick command-bar UX.

## 📚 Documents Stack Checklist

* [ ] **Narrative Hooks in PRD**
  Drop the punchy NL-command example (“Create an investor pitch…”) front-and-center in the Problem Statement .

* [ ] **Embed ROI KPIs**
  Make “0.3 s latency,” “95 % accuracy” explicit acceptance criteria in the PRD and add test cases in Dev Test Plan .

* [ ] **Unified Interface Visuals**
  Snapshot the mock-up from `05_unified_interface_complete.html` into your UXUID or System Architecture docs so there’s no guesswork .

* [ ] **“Professional Guarantee” Tests**
  In Dev Test Plan, add end-to-end checks for McKinsey-level polish (font, color, logo consistency) as shown in the demo workflow .

* [ ] **Developer Quickstart Guide**
  Create a standalone Quickstart (in `/docs`) with CLI/cURL examples, SDK snippets and a “First API Call” tutorial.

* [ ] **Security & Compliance Handbook**
  Add a Threat Model, license audit schedule, dependency-update cadence, data-retention & deletion policies to the O\&E Handbook .

* [ ] **Pricing & Packaging Spec**
  Document internal pricing tiers, billing flows, and AI-credit accounting in a “Commercial Model” doc.

* [ ] **Accessibility & Localization Plan**
  Extend UXUID with WCAG checkpoints, keyboard-only flows, and hooks for future language packs.

* [ ] **CI/CD & Packaging Roadmap**
  Define installer/auto-update strategy, code signing, and your CI/CD pipeline in the Dev Test Plan or Ops handbook.

* [ ] **AI-Ops Strategy**
  Specify prompt-versioning, retry/back-off, token-budget management and error-handling workflows in AIDD .

* [ ] **Performance Profiling & Indexing**
  Add a section to the System Architecture doc for benchmark targets, profiling tools and background indexing plans.

* [ ] **Cross-Platform Abstraction**
  In System Architecture or Onboarding spec, outline the layer that will isolate COM automation for future macOS/Linux support.

Feel free to pick the few highest-impact items for your next sprint—this will tighten the gap between “impressive demo” and “production-ready platform.”
