Of course.

We have now fully defined the product, the cloud architecture, the web-native design system, and the collaborative AI brain. The next critical step is to define the "language" of our systemâ€”the precise, unambiguous contract that allows all these independent components to communicate flawlessly.

This document is the master blueprint for all data exchange within the PrezI Cloud platform.

Here is **Document 5 of 10**, the definitive API Specification for the PrezI SaaS platform.

### **Document 5 of 10: API Specification - SaaS Edition**

# PrezI Cloud: Complete API Specification

*   **Version:** 2.0 (SaaS)
*   **Date:** June 7, 2025
*   **Status:** Finalized

## 1. General Principles

*   **Base URL:** All API endpoints are prefixed with `https://api.prezi.ai/v1`.
*   **Authentication:** All requests must include a `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>` header. The JWT (JSON Web Token) will be issued by the Authentication Service upon successful login.
*   **Data Format:** All request and response bodies must be in `application/json`.
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** All authenticated requests will be scoped to the user's `team_id` on the backend. A user cannot access data from another team, even if they guess the ID.
*   **Error Responses:** Standard HTTP status codes will be used. Error responses will contain a JSON body: `{ "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "..." } }`.

## 2. API Endpoints

### 2.1. Authentication (`/auth`)
*   `POST /auth/register`: Creates a new user and team.
*   `POST /auth/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.
*   `POST /auth/sso/google`: Initiates SSO login with Google.

### 2.2. Team Management (`/team`)
*   `GET /team/members`: Retrieves a list of all members in the user's team.
*   `POST /team/invites`: Sends email invitations to new team members.
*   `PUT /team/members/{user_id}/role`: Changes the role of a team member (Admin only).

### 2.3. Projects & Slides (`/projects`)
*   `GET /projects`: Retrieves all projects for the team.
*   `POST /projects`: Creates a new project.
*   `GET /projects/{project_id}/slides`: Retrieves slides for a specific project, with pagination (`?limit=50&cursor=...`).
*   `POST /projects/{project_id}/files/upload-url`: **[CRITICAL FOR SAAS]** Gets a secure, pre-signed S3 URL to which the client can directly upload a `.pptx` file. This prevents large file uploads from overwhelming the API server. The request returns the URL and a `file_id`. Once the client uploads the file, it notifies the backend to begin processing.

### 2.4. Global Search (`/search`)
*   `GET /search/all?query=...&limit=50&cursor=...`: Performs a global, paginated search across all slides the user has access to.

### 2.5. Assemblies (`/assemblies`) - Now Collaborative
*   `GET /assemblies`: Retrieves all presentation assemblies.
*   `POST /assemblies`: Creates a new, empty assembly.
*   `GET /assemblies/{assembly_id}`: Retrieves the state of a specific assembly, including the list of slides and comments.
*   `POST /assemblies/{assembly_id}/slides`: Adds a slide to an assembly.
*   `POST /assemblies/{assembly_id}/share`: Shares an assembly with a team member, granting them view or edit permissions.
*   `POST /assemblies/{assembly_id}/comments`: Adds a comment to a slide within an assembly.

### 2.6. PrezI AI Engine (`/prezi`)
*   `POST /prezi/interpret`: Takes a user's natural language command and returns the structured intent. The request body now includes team context.
*   `POST /prezi/plan`: Generates a Visual Plan.
*   `POST /prezi/execute`: **[ASYNCHRONOUS]** Executes a PrezI plan. Returns a `task_id`. The client will listen for progress on the WebSocket connection.
*   `POST /prezi/harmonize`: **[ASYNCHRONOUS]** Triggers the AI-powered style harmonization for a given assembly. Returns a `task_id`.

### 2.7. Brand Kit (`/brandkit`) - Admin Only
*   `GET /brandkit`: Retrieves the team's Brand Kit.
*   `POST /brandkit/logo`: Uploads a new logo.
*   `PUT /brandkit/colors`: Updates the team's official color palette.
*   `PUT /brandkit/fonts`: Updates the team's official fonts.

## 3. WebSocket API (`wss://api.prezi.ai/ws`)

The client will maintain a single, persistent WebSocket connection after login to receive real-time updates.

### Server-to-Client Events

*   **`TASK_PROGRESS`**: Provides real-time updates on asynchronous jobs (upload processing, AI execution).
    *   Payload: `{ "task_id": "string", "status": "processing", "message": "Analyzing slide 15 of 50...", "progress": 0.5 }`
*   **`ASSEMBLY_UPDATED`**: Sent to all connected clients when an assembly they are viewing is changed by another user.
    *   Payload: `{ "assembly_id": "string", "updated_by": { "user_id": "string", "name": "David" }, "changes": [{ "action": "add_slide", "slide_id": "string" }] }`
*   **`NEW_COMMENT`**: Sent when a new comment is added to an assembly.
    *   Payload: `{ "assembly_id": "string", "comment": { ...comment_object... } }`
*   **`USER_PRESENCE_CHANGED`**: Shows which users are currently viewing/editing an assembly.
    *   Payload: `{ "assembly_id": "string", "active_users": [{ "user_id": "string", "name": "Sarah" }] }`

This API specification provides the robust, secure, and scalable contract necessary for the PrezI SaaS platform. It prioritizes a responsive user experience by offloading heavy tasks to an asynchronous pipeline and using WebSockets for real-time collaborative updates.
