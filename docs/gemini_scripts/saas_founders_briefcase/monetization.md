Of course. The plan unfolds with precision.

We have now architected the product, the cloud infrastructure, the web interface, the collaborative AI, the API contract, and the multi-tenant database. The blueprint is comprehensive.

The next critical document we must create is one unique to the SaaS model: the **Monetization & Pricing Plan**. This document defines the *business logic* of the application. It's the blueprint for how PrezI will grow from a product into a sustainable business. It directly informs which features are available to which users and how the application will generate revenue.

Here is **Document 7 of 10**, the definitive plan for PrezI's business model.

*   **Version:** 2.0 (SaaS)
*   **Date:** June 7, 2025
*   **Status:** Finalized

## 1. Pricing Philosophy

Our pricing strategy is designed to be simple, value-based, and scalable. The core philosophy is **"Start for free, upgrade as you grow."** We will remove all friction for individual users to adopt PrezI, creating a powerful funnel for team and enterprise adoption. Our pricing tiers are based on the distinct value propositions offered to different user segments: individuals, power users, and collaborative teams.

## 2. Subscription Tiers

PrezI Cloud will offer three primary subscription tiers.

### **Tier 1: Personal (Free)**
*   **Tagline:** *Organize your mind. For free, forever.*

    *   **Ecosystem Integrations:** Access to Slack, Salesforce, and other integrations.
    *   **Single Sign-On (SSO).**

## 3. Billing & Subscription Management

*   **Payment Processor:** We will integrate with **Stripe** to handle all credit card processing and subscription logic. This is a secure, reliable, and industry-standard choice.
*   **Billing Portal:** A self-serve billing portal will be available for team admins. They can:
    *   Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel their subscription.
    *   Update payment information.
    *   View and download past invoices.
    *   Add or remove user seats from their plan.
*   **Trial Period:** New teams will be offered a **14-day free trial** of the Teams plan to experience the full collaborative value before committing.

## 4. Implementation Details

*   **Feature Gating:** The backend API will be responsible for enforcing the limits of each tier. The user's JWT will contain their `subscription_tier`, and an API middleware will check permissions before allowing an action (e.g., checking the slide count before allowing an import on the free plan).
*   **Upgrade Paths:** The UI will contain clear, non-intrusive prompts to upgrade when a user hits a limit or attempts to use a feature from a higher tier. For example, clicking the "Share" button on the Professional plan will trigger a modal explaining that this feature is available on the Teams plan, with a clear call-to-action to upgrade.

This Monetization Plan provides a clear path to commercial success by aligning price with value and creating a powerful engine for both individual user adoption and high-value team sales.
