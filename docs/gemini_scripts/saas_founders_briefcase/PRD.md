You are absolutely right. My apologies. The **Project Layout File** is not just a detail; it's the blueprint for the entire engineering workspace. It is essential. Thank you for holding me to the standard of perfection we've established.

I will add the `Project Folder Layout - SaaS Edition` to our list, bringing the total number of documents in our new "Founder's Briefcase" to a perfect ten.

We will proceed with absolute precision, one document at a time. The vision is to transform PrezI into a collaborative, cloud-native platform. Let's lay the first, most critical foundation.

Here is **Document 1 of 10**, the definitive requirements for the PrezI SaaS product.

### **Document 1 of 10: Product Requirements Document - SaaS Edition**

# PrezI Cloud: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

*   **Version:** 2.0 (SaaS)
*   **Date:** June 7, 2025
*   **Status:** Finalized

## 1. Vision: The Centralized Slide Universe

### 1.1. The Problem, Evolved
The pain of the "slide chaos" is not an individual problem; it's an organizational one. When a team's collective knowledge is scattered across hundreds of local desktops, the result is duplicated work, inconsistent branding, and a crippling inability to leverage past successes. The company's most valuable intellectual property—its stories, data, and strategies—is locked away in digital silos. This inefficiency compounds, costing companies millions in wasted hours and lost opportunities.

### 1.2. The SaaS Solution: A Single Source of Truth
PrezI Cloud transforms the personal slide library into a **living, collaborative, and centralized slide universe for an entire organization.** It is the single, secure home for every slide a team creates, automatically organized, instantly searchable, and always on-brand. By moving to a SaaS model, PrezI becomes the core of a team's presentation workflow, enabling real-time collaboration, unlocking team-wide insights, and ensuring that every presentation delivered by anyone in the company is a perfect reflection of the brand's brilliance.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

### 2.1. Persona 1: "Sarah, the Marketing Director" (The Power User)
*   **Her Role Evolves:** Sarah is now not just a creator but a **brand guardian**. She uses PrezI to define and enforce brand consistency across her entire team.
*   **Her New Goal:** "I want to create a 'gold standard' library of approved slides that my team can use to build their own presentations, so I can ensure every deck that leaves our company is perfect."

### 2.2. Persona 2: "David, the Sales Rep" (The Team Member)
*   **Who He Is:** A driven salesperson who needs to create customized pitches quickly. He is not a designer.
*   **His Goal:** "I need to build a compelling pitch for a new client in under 15 minutes before my next call. I want to use the latest, marketing-approved slides without having to hunt for them or ask for permission."

### 2.3. Persona 3: "Admin Alex" (The Team Lead/Admin)
*   **Who They Are:** A team lead or IT administrator responsible for managing the team's software and users.
*   **Their Goal:** "I need to easily manage my team's access to PrezI, see how it's being used, and ensure our company's data is secure."
