You are correct. We have arrived at the final document.

This is the culmination of our entire planning process. It is the master site plan that shows the AI coding agent exactly how to structure the workspace for this new, ambitious SaaS product. It is designed for clarity, scalability, and professional-grade development.

With this document, the "Founder's Briefcase" for PrezI Cloud will be complete. The blueprint will be perfect.

Here is **Document 10 of 10**, the definitive Project Folder Layout for the PrezI SaaS platform.

### **Document 10 of 10: Official Project Folder Layout - SaaS Edition**

# PrezI Cloud: Official Project Folder Layout

*   **Version:** 2.0 (SaaS)
*   **Date:** June 7, 2025
*   **Status:** Finalized

## 1. Rationale

This folder structure is designed to support a modern, microservice-based, cloud-native application. It enforces a strict separation of concerns between the frontend client, the various backend services, and the infrastructure code. This modularity is critical for team scalability, independent deployments, and long-term maintainability.

## 2. Top-Level Directory Structure

The entire project will be housed in a single monorepo to simplify dependency management and cross-service imports.

```
prezi_cloud_saas/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore               # Specifies files/folders to be ignored by version control.
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json             # Root package.json for managing monorepo workspaces (e.g., using Lerna or Yarn Workspaces).
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # The top-level project overview and setup guide.

```

## 3. Key Architectural Choices in the Layout

*   **Monorepo (`packages/`):** By treating each service and the frontend as a separate package within a single repository, we can easily manage shared code (like data models or validation schemas) and streamline the development workflow.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (`infrastructure/`):** The entire cloud setup is version-controlled and reproducible. This is the essence of professional cloud development. It prevents manual configuration errors and allows us to spin up a complete staging environment with a single command.
*   **Service-Oriented Backend (`packages/service-*`):** Each backend microservice is completely independent. `service-auth` can be updated without affecting `service-slides`. This allows for independent scaling and deployment, which is a massive advantage for a growing SaaS product.
*   **Modern Frontend Setup (`packages/frontend-app/`):** The frontend is structured like a professional React application, with clear separation for components, pages, and services, making it easy to maintain and scale.

This project layout provides the clean, professional, and scalable foundation required to build the PrezI SaaS platform. It is the final piece of the blueprint, giving the AI coding agent a perfect site plan upon which to begin construction.
