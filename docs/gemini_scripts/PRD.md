## 1. The Vision: From Chaos to Clarity

### 1.1. The Problem: A Story of Presentation Purgatory

Every day, a battle is waged in offices around the world. It’s a quiet, desperate struggle fought by millions of professionals armed with nothing but a mouse and a blinking cursor. It's the battle against the **Slide Chaos**.

Our story begins with a talented, high-performing manager—let's call him the "Boss." He's smart, he's driven, but on the eve of every major pitch, he descends into a personal kind of purgatory. For **four to five agonizing hours**, he becomes a digital archeologist, digging through the fossil layers of past presentations. Dozens of windows are open, each a portal to a different project, a different time, a different design language.

He's hunting for that one perfect slide. He *knows* he made it. That killer chart from Q3. That perfect customer quote from last year's conference. But where is it? `Sales_Deck_v4_Final.pptx`? `Investor_Update_FINAL_final_2.pptx`?

When he finally finds the slides, the real nightmare begins. He copy-pastes them into a new deck, and the result is a visual Frankenstein's monster—a mess of clashing fonts, inconsistent colors, and misaligned logos. The brand identity is lost. The professional polish is gone. The story is fragmented. He spends hours more trying to force them into a cohesive whole, a draining, soul-crushing exercise in manual formatting.

This isn't just one manager's story. It's a silent epidemic of wasted potential, a **$50 billion drain on productivity**. It's the friction that stands between a great idea and a compelling presentation.

### 1.2. The Solution: Introducing PrezI, Your AI Presentation Partner

What if the "Boss" could simply state his intent?

What if he could open a single, beautiful workspace and say:

> "I need a pitch for the BigCorp investors. Focus on our Q4 results and our growth strategy for 2025."

And in response, a brilliant AI partner doesn't just give him a list of files, but says:

> "I understand. Here is my plan to build you a powerful, 15-slide story. I will pull the Q4 revenue chart, the approved 2025 roadmap, and the team highlights from the last all-hands. I will ensure every slide uses our latest brand guidelines. Shall I proceed?"

This is PrezI.

PrezI is not another slide-creation tool. **PrezI is an intelligent manager for your entire slide universe.** She understands the content *inside* every slide, learns your style, maintains your brand, and helps you craft compelling stories from your best work, in minutes, not hours. She transforms the chaos into a clear, searchable library and turns your intent into a professional presentation.

## 2. Target Audience & User Persona

### 2.1. Primary Persona: "Sarah, the Marketing Director"

*   **Who She Is:** A marketing director at a fast-growing tech startup or agency. She's strategically brilliant but constantly under pressure to deliver.
*   **Her Job:** She creates 3-4 high-stakes presentations per week—for sales enablement, campaign results, board updates, and new pitches. Her slide library is her intellectual property.
*   **Technical Skills:** Power user of PowerPoint but not a professional designer. She knows what "good" looks like but struggles to achieve it consistently under pressure. She's optimistic and excited about AI tools that can give her a competitive edge.
*   **Her #1 Pain Point:** **Looking Unprofessional.** Her biggest fear is presenting a deck that looks slapped together. It undermines her credibility and the quality of her ideas. This is followed closely by brand inconsistency, the time spent searching, and the stress of tight deadlines.

## 3. Guiding Principles

These principles will guide every design and development decision.

1.  **AI as a Partner, Not a Vending Machine:** PrezI collaborates, suggests, and explains. She doesn't just spit out results. The user is always in control.
2.  **Flow Over Friction:** The user should feel like they are gliding through the process, not fighting the software. Every click, every transition should feel intuitive and purposeful.
3.  **Professional Output is Non-Negotiable:** The final exported PPTX file is the ultimate measure of success. It *must* be beautiful, consistent, and boardroom-ready. No exceptions.
4.  **From Intent to Presentation:** The core user journey is understanding what the user *wants to achieve* and handling all the tedious steps to get there.
5.  **A Living, Breathing Interface:** The app should feel alive, intelligent, and responsive, with subtle animations and feedback that create a delightful, non-robotic experience.

## 4. Detailed Feature Requirements

### Epic 1: The Unified Hybrid Application

This epic covers the foundational architecture of the application.

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | UI/UX Notes | PrezI's Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | As a user, I want a single, installable desktop application so that I can work securely with my local files. | - The app is packaged as a standard installer (`.exe`/`.dmg`).<br>- The app runs natively on Windows and macOS.<br>- All user data and presentation files remain on the local machine by default. | A professional installer with branding. The app should have a standard application icon and system menu. | PrezI's AI models are called via API, but the core logic and user data reside locally, ensuring security. |
| **1.2** | As a user, I want the app's interface to be as fluid, modern, and beautiful as a web app. | - The entire UI is rendered using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.<br>- Animations and transitions are smooth (target 60fps).<br>- The visual design from the `index.html` mockup (dark theme, gradients, etc.) is the standard. | This allows PrezI's personality (animations, visual feedback) to be implemented with the richness of web technologies. | |
| **1.3** | As a user, I want the UI and the backend engine to communicate seamlessly and instantly. | - A local web server or IPC bridge is established on app startup.<br>- UI actions trigger Python functions with a latency of <50ms.<br>- The Python backend can push updates to the UI in real-time (e.g., progress updates). | This bridge is how PrezI's "thoughts" and "plans" from the Python backend are visualized in the UI. | |

### Epic 2: The Slide Universe (Import & Management)

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | UI/UX Notes | PrezI's Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | As a user, I want to import all my existing PowerPoint files into a project so I have a single source of truth. | - User can import multiple `.pptx` files at once via file picker or drag-and-drop.<br>- The original files are copied into a sandboxed project directory.<br>- A visual progress bar and status text (`Converting slide 15 of 50...`) are always visible during import. | A beautiful, full-screen import area with clear progress visualization. Fades away to reveal the library as slides are processed. | **Auto-Tagging:** PrezI analyzes the content of each slide during import to suggest keywords for the slide and its elements.<br>**Duplicate Detection:** PrezI identifies and flags identical or near-identical slides. |
| **2.2** | As a user, I want every slide to be processed so I can see and search its content. | - COM automation is used to connect to a local PowerPoint/OpenOffice instance.<br>- Each slide is converted into a high-resolution image (e.g., 1920x1080 PNG).<br>- All text content, including titles, body, and speaker notes, is extracted and stored. | Thumbnails in the library are sharp and clear. Text content is immediately searchable. | **Content Understanding:** PrezI parses the extracted text to understand the slide's topic, sentiment, and key entities. This feeds into the auto-tagging. |
| **2.3** | As a user, I want to tag slides and individual elements with keywords so I can find them easily later. | - In the slide detail view, users can add/remove text keywords for the entire slide.<br>- Users can toggle an "Element Mode" which overlays selectable bounding boxes on slide elements (charts, images, text).<br>- Clicking an element allows the user to assign specific keywords to just that element.<br>- Overlays are visually distinct for "selected" vs. "already tagged" states. | A clean, intuitive tagging interface. Autocomplete suggests existing keywords. The element selection should feel precise and responsive. | **Keyword Suggestion:** Based on element type and content (e.g., recognizes a bar chart and suggests "chart," "data," "revenue"), PrezI suggests relevant keywords. |
| **2.4** | As a user, I want a robust keyword management system so I can keep my tags organized. | - A dedicated panel shows all keywords in the project.<br>- Keywords can be color-coded by the user for categorization.<br>- Users can rename and merge keywords (e.g., merge "Sales" and "Revenue").<br>- Clicking a keyword in the panel instantly filters the slide library. | Visual, pill-shaped tags with colors. The management interface should be as simple as a to-do list. | **Semantic Clustering:** PrezI can analyze the keyword list and suggest merges or categorizations ("It looks like 'Q4', 'Qtr 4', and 'Fourth Quarter' are all related. Should I merge them?"). |

### Epic 3: The Intelligent Assembly Workshop

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | UI/UX Notes | PrezI's Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1** | As a user, I want to search for slides using natural language so I can find what I need without guessing keywords. | - A single, universal command bar is the primary point of interaction.<br>- The user can type queries like "revenue charts from last quarter" or "slides that mention BigCorp."<br>- The slide library updates in real-time to show matching results. | The command bar from the mockup, with cycling placeholder text to educate the user on what's possible. Search results are animated and highlighted. | **Semantic Search:** PrezI translates the natural language query into a structured database search, looking at keywords, extracted text, and its own content understanding. |
| **3.2** | As a user, I want to build a new presentation by adding slides to an assembly area. | - The Assembly panel is always visible (but collapsible) on the right.<br>- Users can drag-and-drop slides from the library into the assembly.<br>- The assembly shows a re-orderable list of mini-thumbnails.<br>- The panel displays a running slide count and estimated presentation duration. | The drag-and-drop should have a pleasing "snap" animation. The duration estimate updates live. | **Smart Suggestions:** As the user builds, PrezI can suggest the next logical slide ("You have a 'Problem' slide. Should I find a 'Solution' slide to follow it?"). |
| **3.3** | As a user, I want to organize my assembly into logical sections. | - Users can add "Section Header" slides within the assembly.<br>- These headers can be named (e.g., "Introduction," "The Data," "Next Steps").<br>- Sections can be collapsed or reordered as a group. | Clean visual dividers in the assembly list. Dragging a header moves the whole section. | **Auto-Sectioning:** After assembling a few slides, PrezI can analyze the flow and suggest logical section breaks and titles. |

### Epic 4: The AI Partner (PrezI Core)

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | UI/UX Notes | PrezI's Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4.1** | As a user, I want to tell PrezI my goal and have her create a presentation plan for me. | - Typing a command like "create an investor pitch" into the command bar triggers PrezI.<br>- PrezI displays a multi-step, human-readable plan (e.g., "1. Find title slides. 2. Analyze Q4 data slides...").<br>- The plan is presented with "Execute," "Modify," and "Cancel" options. | This is the "WOW Moment" from the mockups. The plan should be clear, visually appealing, and instill confidence. | This *is* PrezI's core intelligence: interpreting intent, formulating a strategy, and presenting it for user approval (Human-in-the-Loop). |
| **4.2** | As a user, I want to watch PrezI execute the plan and have the ability to stop her at any time. | - Clicking "Execute" initiates the automated workflow.<br>- A progress overlay shows which step PrezI is currently working on.<br>- The main UI updates in real-time as slides are added to the assembly.<br>- A sleek, unobtrusive "Emergency Stop" button is always visible during execution. | The progress overlay should be informative and reassuring. The stop button provides a critical sense of control. | PrezI provides status updates in her own voice ("Okay, finding the best charts now... ✨"). |
| **4.3** | As a user, I want PrezI to ensure the final presentation is visually consistent and professional. | - When assembling slides from different sources, PrezI analyzes their formatting.<br>- She identifies a dominant style or uses a user-selected template.<br>- All slides in the final export are automatically re-formatted to match the target style (fonts, colors, logos). | The "Professional Guarantee." This happens during the export process. The user can be shown a "before/after" comparison. | **Style Harmonization:** PrezI uses computer vision and layout analysis to intelligently apply a consistent theme without breaking the slide's original layout. |

### Epic 5: The Professional Export

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | UI/UX Notes | PrezI's Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5.1** | As a user, I want to export my assembled presentation into a fully-editable PowerPoint file. | - The final output is a standard `.pptx` file.<br>- All text remains editable.<br>- All charts are native PowerPoint charts (if possible) or high-quality images.<br>- Speaker notes from the original slides are preserved. | A clean export dialog with options for filename and location. A satisfying "Done!" confirmation. | PrezI ensures the exported file is not just a collection of images, but a genuinely professional and editable PowerPoint document. |
| **5.2** | As a user, I want the exported file to automatically open so I can review it immediately. | - After the export process completes, the newly created `.pptx` file is launched in the user's default PowerPoint application. | Seamless transition from PrezI to PowerPoint. | PrezI's final handover to the user, completing the workflow. |
