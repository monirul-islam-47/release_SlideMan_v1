# Quick Fix - Use Original with Minimal Changes

Since the refactored version isn't displaying properly, here's the quickest solution:

## Option 1: Use Original index.html (Fastest)

Just make these 2 minimal changes to your original `index.html`:

### 1. Fix Form (Line ~6388)
Find:
```html
<form id="requestAccessForm" class="access-form">
```

Change to:
```html
<form id="requestAccessForm" class="access-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

### 2. Fix Analytics (Lines 62 & 67)
Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual Google Analytics ID

That's it! Your beautiful page stays exactly as is.

## Option 2: Test Refactored Version Locally

If you want to use the refactored version, you need to run a local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or Node.js
npx http-server

# Or VS Code Live Server extension
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000/index_refactored_complete.html

The issue is that browsers block local file:// CSS loading for security. A local server fixes this.

## Option 3: All-in-One File (Works Everywhere)

I can create a version with all CSS/JS embedded back in the HTML (organized but in one file) that will work when opened directly. Want me to do this?

## Recommendation

For now, just use your original `index.html` with the form and analytics fixes. It's beautiful, it works, and you can deploy it immediately!
