## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts to Remember

### 1. The Core Problem
- Executives waste 4-5 hours searching through presentations
- Content is scattered across hundreds of files
- No way to find specific charts or elements
- Manual assembly is error-prone
- "I know I have that slide somewhere..." - Universal pain point

### 2. PrezI's Unique Value
- **Element-level understanding**: Knows what's IN each slide
- **Natural language interface**: "Create investor pitch for BigCorp"
- **Professional guarantee**: McKinsey-level output every time
- **Personality**: She's excited, helpful, and celebrates successes
- **Speed**: 90% time reduction (5 hours â†’ 30 minutes)

### 3. Technical Architecture
- Python/Qt desktop application (existing SlideMan)
- PowerPoint COM automation for slide conversion
- SQLite with FTS5 for search
- GPT-4o for real-time AI, o3 for complex analysis
- Element recognition via custom computer vision
- Keywords system with colors and priorities

### 4. User Journey
```
Import Files â†’ PrezI Auto-tags â†’ User Searches Naturally â†’ 
PrezI Suggests â†’ User Assembles â†’ PrezI Ensures Quality â†’ Export
```

### 5. Branding Decision
- It's "PrezI" not "SlideMan + PREZI"
- PrezI is the star, the differentiator
- SlideMan becomes the underlying technology
- Purple (#667eea) to blue (#764ba2) gradient aesthetic
- Morphing, organic avatar (not robotic)
- Dark theme (#0a0a0a background)
