## 🎨 Visual Design Philosophy

### The PrezI Universe

Every interaction happens in PrezI's "mind space" - a dynamic, living environment where:

1. **Slides float like memories** - Recent ones bright and close, older ones distant and faded
2. **Keywords orbit like planets** - Related concepts gravitationally attracted
3. **Connections spark like synapses** - When PrezI finds relationships
4. **The background breathes** - Subtle movements show PrezI is alive and thinking

### Micro-Interactions That Delight

- **Hover over a slide**: PrezI's particles gather around it, showing interest
- **Drag a slide**: Trail of stardust follows, making movement magical
- **Complete a task**: PrezI does a little celebration dance
- **Type a command**: Words appear letter by letter in PrezI's thought bubble
- **Find perfect match**: Lightning bolt connects PrezI to the slide
