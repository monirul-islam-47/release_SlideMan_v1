# Phase 2 Handover Notes

## Dear Phase 2 Developer,

Welcome! You're about to work on Phase 2 of the SLIDEMAN refactoring project. This document will help you understand what was done in Phase 1 and how to proceed.

## Current State

### Phase 1 Completed Items âœ…
1. **Thread-safe database layer** with connection pooling
2. **Standardized error handling** with custom exceptions
3. **Thread-safe worker services** (slide converter, export service)
4. **Basic service layer separation** from UI

### What's NOT Yet Applied
The Phase 1 refactoring has been completed but **NOT YET APPLIED** to the actual codebase. All refactored files have "_new" suffix and are ready for migration.

## How to Apply Phase 1 Changes

### Step 1: Review the Changes
First, review what was changed:
```bash
# Compare the refactored files with originals
diff src/slideman/services/database.py src/slideman/services/database_new.py
diff src/slideman/services/slide_converter.py src/slideman/services/slide_converter_new.py
diff src/slideman/services/export_service.py src/slideman/services/export_service_new.py

# Review new files
cat src/slideman/services/exceptions.py
cat src/slideman/services/database_worker.py
```

### Step 2: Run the Migration Script
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
python migrate_phase1.py
```

**What the script does:**
1. Creates timestamped backups of original files in `src/slideman/services/backups/`
2. Replaces original files with refactored versions
3. Removes the temporary "_new" files
4. Updates worker instantiation in UI files where needed
5. Provides a summary of changes

### Step 3: Verify the Migration
```bash
# Check that backups were created
ls -la src/slideman/services/backups/

# Verify the new files are in place
grep -n "class Database" src/slideman/services/database.py  # Should show connection pool implementation
grep -n "DatabaseWorker" src/slideman/services/slide_converter.py  # Should show worker usage
```

### Step 4: Update Remaining UI Files
The migration script updates some imports, but you'll need to manually update error handling in UI files:

**Example updates needed:**
```python
# OLD PATTERN (in UI files)
project = self.db.get_project(project_id)
if not project:
    QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Project not found")
    return

# NEW PATTERN (use exceptions)
try:
    project = self.db.get_project(project_id)
except ResourceNotFoundError:
    QMessageBox.warning(self, "Not Found", "Project not found")
    return
except DatabaseError as e:
    QMessageBox.critical(self, "Database Error", str(e))
    return
```

### Step 5: Run Tests
```bash
# Run existing tests to ensure nothing broke
pytest

# Test thread safety manually:
# 1. Open the application
# 2. Start converting multiple PowerPoint files simultaneously
# 3. While conversion is running, try to export a presentation
# 4. Verify no "database locked" errors occur
```

## Phase 2 Objectives

Based on the refactoring analysis, Phase 2 should focus on **Architecture** (2-3 weeks):

### 1. Introduce Presenter Pattern for UI Pages
Create presenter classes to separate business logic from UI:
```python
# Example: src/slideman/presenters/projects_presenter.py
class ProjectsPresenter:
    def __init__(self, view: ProjectsView, project_service: ProjectService):
        self.view = view
        self.service = project_service
    
    def create_project(self, name: str, files: List[str]):
        # Business logic here, not in UI
        try:
            project = self.service.create_project(name, files)
            self.view.show_project(project)
        except DuplicateResourceError as e:
            self.view.show_error("Project already exists")
```

### 2. Implement Dependency Injection
Replace singleton access with proper DI:
```python
# Instead of:
from ..app_state import app_state
db = app_state.db_service

# Use:
class ServiceRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self._services = {}
    
    def register(self, name: str, service: Any):
        self._services[name] = service
    
    def get(self, name: str) -> Any:
        return self._services[name]
```

### 3. Standardize Command Pattern
All commands should follow the same pattern:
```python
# Base command class
class BaseCommand(QUndoCommand):
    def __init__(self, description: str, service_registry: ServiceRegistry):
        super().__init__(description)
        self.registry = service_registry
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)
```

### 4. Extract Service Interfaces
Define clear contracts for services:
```python
# src/slideman/services/interfaces.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IProjectService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_project(self, name: str, files: List[Path]) -> Project:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def delete_project(self, project_id: int) -> None:
        pass
```

## Important Files to Review

1. **Refactoring Analysis:** `refactoring_analysis_report.md` - Full analysis of issues
2. **Phase 1 Summary:** `phase1_refactoring_summary.md` - What was done
3. **New Exception Module:** `src/slideman/services/exceptions.py` - Exception hierarchy
4. **Database Worker:** `src/slideman/services/database_worker.py` - Thread-safe pattern

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Import Errors**: Some UI files might need manual import updates after migration
2. **Command Pattern**: Commands using `app_state` need updating to use injected services
3. **Tests**: May need updates to handle new exception types
4. **Thumbnail Cache**: Still needs refactoring to remove `app_state` dependency

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong after migration:
```bash
# Restore from backups (replace timestamp with actual)
cp src/slideman/services/backups/database_20250106_120000.py src/slideman/services/database.py
cp src/slideman/services/backups/slide_converter_20250106_120000.py src/slideman/services/slide_converter.py
cp src/slideman/services/backups/export_service_20250106_120000.py src/slideman/services/export_service.py

# Remove new files
rm src/slideman/services/exceptions.py
rm src/slideman/services/database_worker.py
```

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Read this handover document completely
- [ ] Review the refactoring analysis report
- [ ] Run the migration script
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Plan Phase 2 architecture improvements
- [ ] Create a new branch for Phase 2 work

## Questions or Issues?

The Phase 1 refactoring focused on critical stability issues. The codebase should now be:
- Thread-safe for database operations
- Using consistent error handling patterns
- Ready for architectural improvements

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the backup files first
2. Review the migration script output
3. Look for any remaining references to old patterns
4. The `CLAUDE.md` file has project-specific guidance

Good luck with Phase 2! The foundation is now solid for the architectural improvements.
