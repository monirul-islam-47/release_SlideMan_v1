# Slideman - Phase 1 Completion Summary

**Phase Goal:** Establish the project skeleton, core Qt application infrastructure, dependencies, resource handling, basic state management, logging, and settings persistence. Essentially, create a runnable application shell with essential background services configured.

---

## Key Accomplishments & Technical Details:

**1. Project Structure & Version Control:**

*   **Files Affected:** Entire project directory (`slideman/`).
*   **Details:**
    *   Created the root project folder `slideman/`.
    *   Initialized a Git repository (`git init`) for version control.
    *   Established the directory structure as planned in `project_layout.md`:
        *   `src/slideman/` (main package)
        *   Sub-packages: `services/`, `models/`, `ui/` (with `components/`, `pages/`), `commands/`
        *   `tests/` (with `unit/`, `gui/`)
        *   `resources/` (with `icons/`, `qss/`)
    *   Added `__init__.py` files to necessary directories to make them Python packages.
    *   Created core project files: `README.md` (placeholder), `LICENSE`, `.gitignore` (populated with standard Python/IDE/App specific patterns), `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Directly implements the planned `project_layout.md` structure, setting the stage for clear separation of concerns.

**2. Environment & Dependencies:**

*   **Files Affected:** `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `.venv/` (managed by Poetry).
*   **Details:**
    *   Used `poetry init` to create `pyproject.toml`, defining project metadata (name: `slideman`, version: `0.1.0`, Python: `~3.9`).
    *   Added runtime dependencies via `poetry add`:
        *   `PySide6 (^6.6)`: The core Qt framework binding.
        *   `pywin32 (>=305)`: For Windows COM automation (PowerPoint interaction).
        *   `Pillow (>=10.0)`: Image handling.
        *   `rapidfuzz (>=3.0)`: Fuzzy string matching for keyword management.
        *   `appdirs (>=1.4)`: Locating standard application directories (logs, cache).
    *   Added development dependencies via `poetry add --group dev`:
        *   `pytest (^7.0)`: Testing framework.
        *   `pytest-qt`: Utilities for testing PySide6 applications.
    *   Poetry created an isolated virtual environment (`.venv/`) and generated `poetry.lock` pinning exact installed versions for reproducibility.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Declares the foundational libraries needed for all layers, particularly `PySide6` for the **Presentation Layer** and **Shared State**, `pywin32` for the **Integration Layer** (COM), and others for specific **Business Logic** (`services/`).

**3. Resource Management (Icons & Stylesheets):**

*   **Files Affected:** `resources/icons/`, `resources/qss/`, `resources/resources.qrc`, `src/slideman/resources_rc.py`, `src/slideman/__main__.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Placed placeholder assets: `app_icon.svg`, `exit.svg` in `resources/icons/`; basic `dark.qss` and `light.qss` in `resources/qss/`.
    *   Created `resources/resources.qrc` defining aliases (e.g., `:/icons/app_icon.svg`, `:/qss/dark.qss`) pointing to the actual resource files.
    *   Compiled the `.qrc` file into `src/slideman/resources_rc.py` using `pyside6-rcc`. This embeds the assets into Python code.
    *   Added `from . import resources_rc` to `src/slideman/__main__.py` to register these embedded resources with Qt's resource system at application startup.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Implements the `resources/` part of the project layout. Provides assets primarily for the **Presentation Layer** (`ui/`). Embedding simplifies packaging later.

**4. Basic Main Window & Application Entry Point:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/ui/main_window.py`, `src/slideman/__main__.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created `src/slideman/ui/main_window.py` defining the `MainWindow` class inheriting `QMainWindow`.
    *   `MainWindow` sets up:
        *   Window title and icon (`:/icons/app_icon.svg`).
        *   Placeholders for the main UI structure (eventually left-nav + `QStackedWidget`). Currently shows a placeholder label.
        *   A `QStatusBar`.
        *   Basic `QAction`s (Quit, Toggle Theme, About) and corresponding `QMenuBar` entries.
        *   Methods `_load_settings` and `_save_settings` using `QSettings` to persist window geometry.
        *   A `toggle_theme` slot connected to the View menu action.
        *   An `about` dialog slot.
    *   Created `src/slideman/__main__.py` as the application entry point:
        *   Sets up `QApplication`, setting Org/App names and version.
        *   Configures High DPI settings (with temporary deprecation warnings).
        *   Calls `setup_logging()` and sets `sys.excepthook = global_exception_hook`.
        *   Imports and registers `resources_rc`.
        *   Initializes and applies the theme using the `theme` module and `QSettings`.
        *   Instantiates `MainWindow`, shows it, and starts the event loop (`app.exec()`).
*   **Architecture Alignment:** `main_window.py` is the root of the **Presentation Layer**. `__main__.py` acts as the top-level **Orchestrator**, setting up shared services (logging, theme) and launching the UI. `QSettings` usage touches on **Persistence**.

**5. Theme Handling Skeleton:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/theme.py`, `src/slideman/__main__.py`, `src/slideman/ui/main_window.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created `src/slideman/theme.py` with functions:
        *   `load_stylesheet(theme_name)`: Reads QSS content from compiled resources (`:/qss/...`). Includes basic error handling.
        *   `apply_theme(app, theme_name)`: Applies the loaded stylesheet to the `QApplication` instance.
        *   `get_current_theme()`: Returns the name of the currently active theme.
    *   `__main__.py` calls `theme.apply_theme` at startup based on `QSettings`.
    *   `main_window.py` has a `toggle_theme` slot calling `theme.apply_theme` and saving the choice to `QSettings`.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Provides a utility service supporting the **Presentation Layer**. Centralizes theme logic.

**6. Logging & Global Exception Handling:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/__main__.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented `setup_logging()`:
        *   Uses `appdirs` to find the standard user log directory.
        *   Configures Python's `logging` with a format.
        *   Adds a `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` to write logs to `app.log` (with size rotation and backup).
        *   Adds a `logging.StreamHandler` to show logs on the console (useful for debugging).
    *   Implemented `global_exception_hook(exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb)`:
        *   Set as `sys.excepthook`.
        *   Catches any uncaught exceptions.
        *   Logs the full traceback critically using `logging`.
        *   Displays a user-friendly `QMessageBox.critical` dialog showing a simple error message, the log file location, and the full traceback in the "Details" section.
        *   Exits the application (`sys.exit(1)`).
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Provides crucial cross-cutting concerns. Logging helps with debugging all layers. The exception hook provides basic application stability and user feedback on critical failures.

**7. Core State Management Skeleton:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/app_state.py`, `src/slideman/event_bus.py`, `src/slideman/__main__.py`, `src/slideman/ui/main_window.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created `src/slideman/app_state.py` defining the `AppState(QObject)` singleton:
        *   Includes `QUndoStack` instance.
        *   Includes placeholders for `current_project_path`, etc.
        *   Defines initial signals (`projectLoaded`, `projectClosed`).
        *   Provides `load_initial_state`, `set_current_project`, `close_project` method stubs.
        *   Includes a global instance `app_state`.
    *   Created `src/slideman/event_bus.py` defining the `EventBus(QObject)` singleton:
        *   Defines placeholder signals for various events (conversion, keywords, UI navigation, etc.) based on `idea.md`.
        *   Includes a global instance `event_bus`.
    *   `__main__.py` imports `app_state`, `event_bus` ensuring they are instantiated, and calls `app_state.load_initial_state()`.
    *   `main_window.py` imports `app_state`, creates Undo/Redo actions using `app_state.undo_stack`, and connects them to the Edit menu. Connects `undo_stack` signals for window title updates.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Establishes the **Shared State** layer (`AppState`, `EventBus`) providing the central state store, undo management, and the decoupled communication mechanism (signals/slots) planned in the architecture.

**Outcome of Phase 1:** A runnable, themed (basic), stable (basic error handling) PySide6 application skeleton. It has the core project structure, dependency management, resource handling, logging, and the central state/event singletons ready. The foundation is laid for implementing the application's specific features in the subsequent phases according to the defined architecture.
