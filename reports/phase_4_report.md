# Slideman - Phase 4 Completion Summary

**Phase Goal:** Implement the core backend process for converting imported PowerPoint files. This involves using PowerPoint COM automation in a background thread to generate slide images (full-resolution and thumbnail), extracting basic element data (type, bounding box) using `python-pptx`, storing this generated data in the database and filesystem, providing UI feedback during the process, and setting up a foundational thumbnail cache service.

## Key Accomplishments & Technical Details:

**1. Database Schema & Service Updates:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/services/database.py`, `src/slideman/models/file.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Incremented `DB_SCHEMA_VERSION` to 2.
    *   Modified the `slides` table schema to store relative paths for both full-resolution images and thumbnails (`image_rel_path`, `thumb_rel_path`).
    *   Modified the `files` table schema to include a `conversion_status` column (`TEXT` with values 'Pending', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Failed', default 'Pending'). Updated the `File` model accordingly.
    *   Updated the `Database.add_slide` method to accept and store both relative image paths, using `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for re-conversion scenarios.
    *   Added `Database.add_element` method to insert element bounding box data (using EMUs) and type.
    *   Added `Database.delete_elements_for_slide` method to clear previous element data before potential re-conversion.
    *   Added `Database.update_file_conversion_status` method.
    *   Added `Database.get_files_for_project` method with optional status filtering (e.g., to find 'Pending'/'Failed' files).
    *   Added `Database.get_slide_thumbnail_path` (for cache service).
    *   Addressed critical SQLite threading issues by implementing a **thread-local database connection** strategy within the `SlideConverter` worker (each worker creates and manages its own connection to the DB file), resolving transaction conflicts (`cannot commit/rollback...` errors). *(Acknowledging external input assisted here)*.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Updated the **Persistence Layer** schema and corresponding methods in the **Business Logic Layer** (`Database` service) to support storing conversion results and status. Addressed necessary **Concurrency** constraints related to database access from multiple threads.

**2. User-Initiated Conversion Trigger:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/ui/pages/projects_page.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Added a "Convert Slides" `QAction` (`convert_action`) to the `ProjectsPage` toolbar.
    *   This action is enabled only when a project is selected in the list view (logic handled in `handle_project_selection_changed`).
    *   Connected the action's `triggered` signal to the `handle_start_conversion` slot.
    *   Removed the automatic conversion trigger from the `handle_copy_finished` slot (project creation).
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Implemented the user interaction element in the **Presentation Layer** according to the revised plan (user-triggered conversion).

**3. Background Conversion Worker (`SlideConverter`):**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/services/slide_converter.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented the `SlideConverter(QRunnable)` class.
    *   Its `run()` method executes on a background thread via `QThreadPool`.
    *   **COM & pptx Interaction:** Initializes COM per thread, opens the target `.pptx` using both `win32com.client` (for `Slide.Export`) and `python-pptx` (for shape data). Handles potential slide count mismatches.
    *   **Image Generation:** For each slide:
        *   Exports a full-resolution PNG image using `slide_com.Export()` to a structured path (`PROJECT_ROOT/converted_data/FILE_ID/image_SLIDEINDEX.png`).
        *   Loads the exported PNG into a `QPixmap`.
        *   Scales the `QPixmap` to `THUMBNAIL_HEIGHT` using `scaledToHeight` with `Qt.SmoothTransformation`.
        *   Saves the scaled pixmap as a thumbnail PNG (`.../thumb_SLIDEINDEX.png`).
    *   **Data Extraction:** Iterates through `slide_pptx.shapes`, extracts shape type (using `map_shape_type` helper) and bounding box (`left`, `top`, `width`, `height` in EMUs), skipping shapes without geometry.
    *   **Database Storage:** Calls `db.add_slide()` (using its thread-local connection) to store relative image/thumbnail paths. Calls `db.delete_elements_for_slide()` before adding new elements via `db.add_element()`.
    *   **Status & Signaling:** Updates the file's `conversion_status` in the database ('Completed' or 'Failed') upon finishing. Emits `progress`, `finished`, or `error` signals via a `SlideConverterSignals` object (created in the main thread and passed in).
    *   **Cleanup:** Includes `finally` block to close the COM presentation, release COM object references, uninitialize COM, and close the thread-local database connection. Does *not* call `ppt_app.Quit()` to avoid interfering with potentially shared PowerPoint instances.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Encapsulates the complex conversion logic within the **Business Logic/Service Layer**. Manages interaction with the external PowerPoint application (**Integration Layer**). Runs asynchronously (**Concurrency**) and communicates results back via signals.

**4. Asynchronous Task Orchestration & UI Feedback:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/ui/pages/projects_page.py`, `src/slideman/services/slide_converter.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented the pattern of creating the worker's signals object (`SlideConverterSignals`) in the main thread (`trigger_slide_conversion`) and passing it to the worker constructor. Slots in `ProjectsPage` connect to this local signals object, resolving cross-thread signal delivery issues.
    *   Implemented `handle_start_conversion` slot: Retrieves selected project, fetches pending/failed files from DB, sets UI to busy state using `_set_ui_busy`.
    *   Implemented `start_conversion_for_project` helper: Initializes progress tracking, updates file status to 'In Progress', loops through files, and calls `trigger_slide_conversion`.
    *   Implemented `trigger_slide_conversion` helper: Creates/configures `SlideConverter` instance (passing DB service, signals object), connects signals, submits worker to `QThreadPool`. Includes error handling for worker start failures.
    *   Implemented slots (`handle_conversion_progress`, `handle_conversion_finished`, `handle_conversion_error`) to receive worker signals.
    *   Implemented `_check_conversion_completion` method using a counter (`_conversion_workers_active`) to track completion of multiple concurrent workers and trigger final UI reset/refresh only when all are finished.
    *   Implemented **improved progress reporting** in `handle_conversion_progress` by calculating and displaying the *overall average* progress based on total slides processed across all active workers, updating a single `QProgressBar`.
    *   Refactored UI state management into a shared `_set_ui_busy` method.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Manages the **Concurrency** aspect from the **Presentation Layer**, correctly triggering background tasks and updating the UI based on thread-safe signals. Uses **EventBus** for status messages.

**5. Thumbnail Cache Foundation:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/services/thumbnail_cache.py`, `src/slideman/app_state.py`, `src/slideman/__main__.py`, `src/slideman/services/database.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created the `ThumbnailCache(QObject)` singleton service.
    *   Uses a simple dictionary (`_memory_cache`) for in-memory caching.
    *   Implemented `get_thumbnail(slide_id)` which checks cache, then uses `AppState` to access the `db_service` and `current_project_path` to load the thumbnail `QPixmap` from the disk path stored in the DB (`get_slide_thumbnail_path` added to `Database`).
    *   Implemented `clear_cache()` slot connected to `AppState.projectClosed`.
    *   Modified `AppState` and `__main__.py` to store and provide the `db_service` instance to the cache (and other potential consumers).
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Implements a caching service within the **Business Logic Layer** (though tightly coupled to presentation needs). Uses **AppState** for accessing shared context (project path, DB). *Note: Integration into actual UI components is deferred.*

**Outcome of Phase 4:** The application can now successfully convert PowerPoint files associated with a project in the background upon user request. It generates slide images (full-res and thumbnail), extracts element data, and stores this information reliably in the database, handling concurrency correctly. Basic progress feedback is provided, and a thumbnail cache service is ready for use. This completes the core data processing pipeline, setting the stage for visually displaying and interacting with slides and elements.

**Deferred Items / Future Refinements from Phase 4:**

*   Integrating `ThumbnailCache` usage into UI views.
*   More sophisticated multi-file progress reporting (e.g., per-file indicators).
*   More detailed error aggregation/reporting from conversion failures.
*   UI implementation for conversion cancellation.
*   Potentially optimizing `SlideConverter` (e.g., COM object reuse, error recovery).
