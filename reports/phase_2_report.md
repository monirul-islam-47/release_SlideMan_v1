# Slideman - Phase 2 Completion Summary

**Phase Goal:** Define the application's core data structures as Python classes and implement the fundamental database service layer responsible for persistence, focusing initially on project-related data. Ensure this database logic is independently testable.

---

## Key Accomplishments & Technical Details:

**1. Data Models Definition:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/models/project.py`, `file.py`, `slide.py`, `element.py`, `keyword.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created individual Python files for each core data entity within the `src/slideman/models/` directory.
    *   Used the `@dataclass` decorator to define simple, type-hinted classes:
        *   `Project(id, name, folder_path, created_at)`
        *   `File(id, project_id, filename, rel_path, slide_count, checksum)`
        *   `Slide(id, file_id, slide_index, thumb_path)`
        *   `Element(id, slide_id, element_type, bbox_x, bbox_y, bbox_w, bbox_h)` - coordinates confirmed as EMU.
        *   `Keyword(id, keyword, kind)` - using `typing.Literal` for the `kind` field (`"topic"`, `"title"`, `"name"`).
    *   These classes serve as Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), providing a structured way to represent data retrieved from or passed to the database service. They contain no Qt dependencies.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Implements the **Data Models** layer as planned. Provides clear, framework-agnostic data structures for use by the **Business Logic** and other layers.

**2. Database Service Setup & Schema Creation:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/services/database.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented the `Database` class within the `services` module.
    *   **Connection Management:** Added `connect()` and `close()` methods to manage the `sqlite3` connection lifecycle. Includes basic error handling for connection failures and enables foreign key constraints (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`). Uses `sqlite3.Row` factory for dictionary-like access. Includes `__enter__` and `__exit__` for `with` statement support.
    *   **Schema Initialization:** Implemented `_initialize_schema()` which checks `PRAGMA user_version`.
    *   **Table Creation:** Implemented `_create_tables()` which executes the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statements precisely matching the schema defined in `idea.md` for `projects`, `files`, `slides`, `elements`, `keywords`, `slide_keywords`, and `element_keywords`. Includes `ON DELETE CASCADE` where specified and `WITHOUT ROWID` optimization for link tables.
    *   **Index Creation:** Implemented `_create_indices()` which executes `CREATE INDEX` statements for foreign keys and other queryable columns (`keywords.keyword`) to enhance performance.
    *   **Migration Foundation:** Established `DB_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant and basic version checking logic, preparing for future schema migrations (though only initial creation is implemented).
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Establishes the core of the **Business Logic Layer**'s interaction with the **Persistence Layer**. Encapsulates all SQL and schema details, fulfilling the separation of concerns principle.

**3. Basic CRUD Operations (Projects):**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/services/database.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Added methods specifically for managing the `projects` table:
        *   `add_project(name, folder_path) -> Optional[int]`: Inserts a new project, handles potential `UNIQUE` constraint errors on `folder_path`, returns the new `id`.
        *   `get_project_by_id(project_id) -> Optional[Project]`: Retrieves a project by its `id`, returning a `Project` model instance or `None`.
        *   `get_project_by_path(folder_path) -> Optional[Project]`: Retrieves a project by its unique `folder_path`.
        *   `get_all_projects() -> List[Project]`: Retrieves all projects, ordered by name (case-insensitive), returning a list of `Project` model instances.
        *   `rename_project(project_id, new_name) -> bool`: Updates the `name` for a given `project_id`.
        *   `delete_project(project_id) -> bool`: Deletes a project by `id` (cascading deletes are handled by the schema definition).
    *   These methods include logging, use parameterized queries (`?`) to prevent SQL injection, handle potential `sqlite3.Error` exceptions, use transactions (`commit`/`rollback`), and map database rows to `Project` model objects.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Provides the first concrete business logic functions within the `Database` service, ready to be consumed by higher layers (like Commands in Phase 3).

**4. Unit Testing (Database - Projects CRUD):**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/tests/services/test_database.py`, `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Configured `pytest` via `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`) to correctly locate the source code (`pythonpath = ["src"]`) and tests (`testpaths = ["tests"]`). Addressed initial `ModuleNotFoundError`.
    *   Implemented a `pytest` fixture (`temp_db`) in `test_database.py` that provides a fresh, schema-initialized, in-memory SQLite database (`:memory:`) for each test function.
    *   Wrote 9 distinct test functions (`test_...`) covering the success, failure, and edge cases for the project CRUD methods (`add_project`, `get_...`, `rename_project`, `delete_project`).
    *   Tests use `assert` statements to verify return values, return types, and the state of the database after operations.
    *   Successfully ran `pytest`, confirming all 9 tests passed.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Validates the **Business Logic Layer** (`Database` service) independently of the UI, ensuring its correctness and providing regression protection. Follows testing best practices. Resolved common test setup import issues related to project layout.

**Outcome of Phase 2:** The application now has a well-defined data representation layer (`models/`) and a functional, tested persistence service (`services/database.py`) capable of managing project entries in an SQLite database. The core data handling infrastructure is in place, ready for the UI and file handling logic in the next phase.
