# Slideman - Phase 3 Completion Summary

**Phase Goal:** Implement the main "Projects" landing page, enabling users to create new projects (including file copying), list existing projects retrieved from the database, and perform Rename/Delete operations with Undo/Redo support. Introduce background processing for file operations to maintain UI responsiveness.

---

## Key Accomplishments & Technical Details:

**1. Projects Page UI Implementation:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/ui/pages/projects_page.py`, `src/slideman/ui/main_window.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created `ProjectsPage(QWidget)` with a two-panel layout (`QHBoxLayout`):
        *   **Left Panel:** Contains a `QToolBar` (for New, Refresh actions) and a `QListView` (`project_list_view`) to display project names. Added a `QProgressBar` (`copy_progress_bar`, initially hidden) below the list view for file copy feedback.
        *   **Right Panel:** Implemented as a `QStackedWidget` (`right_panel`) containing placeholder `QLabel`s for a "Welcome" message (index 0) and "Project Details" (index 1).
    *   Integrated `ProjectsPage` into `MainWindow`'s central `QStackedWidget`.
    *   Implemented basic navigation in `MainWindow` using `QPushButton`s in a left `QFrame` connected to `stacked_widget.setCurrentIndex()`.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Implements the primary UI component for project management within the **Presentation Layer** (`ui/pages/`). Establishes the visual structure described in `idea.md`.

**2. Project List Model & View Integration:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/ui/pages/projects_page.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented `ProjectListModel(QAbstractListModel)` to manage `Project` data objects.
    *   Overrides `rowCount()` and `data()` methods to provide project names (`DisplayRole`) and IDs/paths (custom roles) to the view.
    *   Implemented `load_projects(projects: List[Project])` method, which updates the internal data and correctly signals view updates using `beginResetModel()` / `endResetModel()`.
    *   Instantiated `ProjectListModel` within `ProjectsPage` and assigned it to `project_list_view` using `setModel()`.
    *   Implemented `load_projects_from_db()` in `ProjectsPage` which now correctly calls `db_service.get_all_projects()` (from Phase 2) and passes the result to `project_model.load_projects()`. This method is called on initialization and by the "Refresh" action.
    *   Connected the `selectionModel().selectionChanged` signal of the list view to a slot (`handle_project_selection_changed`) which enables/disables context actions and switches the right panel display.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Follows Qt's Model-View pattern within the **Presentation Layer**. Decouples data storage (`ProjectListModel`) from data presentation (`QListView`). Connects the UI to the **Business Logic Layer** (`Database` service) for data retrieval.

**3. File I/O Service Implementation:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/services/file_io.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created the `file_io` service module.
    *   Implemented `check_disk_space(target_path, required_bytes)` using `shutil.disk_usage` and `pathlib.Path.anchor` for Windows compatibility (avoiding `is_mount`). Returns `(bool, free_bytes)`.
    *   Implemented `calculate_checksum(file_path)` using `hashlib.sha256` and chunked file reading for efficiency. Returns `Optional[str]`.
    *   Implemented `copy_files_to_project(source_paths, project_folder)` which performs pre-flight disk space check (raising `OSError` on failure), creates the destination folder, copies files using `shutil.copy2`, calculates checksums *after* copying, handles copy errors per file, and returns a dictionary `Dict[rel_path_str, checksum_or_None]` for successfully copied files.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Implements a key part of the **Business Logic Layer**, encapsulating filesystem operations and separating them from UI and database concerns.

**4. "New Project" Workflow (with Background Copy):**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/ui/pages/projects_page.py`, `src/slideman/services/background_tasks.py`, `src/slideman/services/database.py`, `src/slideman/ui/main_window.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Passed the `db_service` instance from `MainWindow` to `ProjectsPage`.
    *   Implemented the `handle_new_project` slot in `ProjectsPage`:
        *   Uses `QFileDialog` and `QInputDialog` to get source files and project name.
        *   Determines a unique project folder path in `Documents/SlidemanProjects`.
        *   Creates a `FileCopyWorker(QRunnable)` instance (defined in `background_tasks.py`) with source paths and destination folder.
        *   Connects worker signals (`finished`, `error`, `progress`) to slots in `ProjectsPage` (`handle_copy_finished`, `handle_copy_error`, `update_copy_progress`).
        *   Updates UI to busy state (shows progress bar, disables actions, sets wait cursor).
        *   Submits the worker to `QThreadPool.globalInstance()`.
    *   Implemented the `handle_copy_finished` slot: Triggered on worker success. Resets UI state. Calls `db_service.add_project` and `db_service.add_file` (required adding `add_file` method to `Database` class) using data received from the worker signal. Calls `load_projects_from_db` to refresh the UI list.
    *   Implemented the `handle_copy_error` slot: Triggered on worker failure. Resets UI state. Shows error message.
    *   Implemented `update_copy_progress` slot: Updates the `QProgressBar`.
    *   Refactored status bar updates to use `event_bus.statusMessageUpdate.emit()` from `ProjectsPage` slots, handled by a slot in `MainWindow`.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Demonstrates UI interaction triggering background tasks. Uses `QThreadPool` for **Concurrency**. Leverages `EventBus` for **Shared State/Communication** (status updates). Calls **Business Logic** (`Database`) *after* the background task completes successfully on the main thread. **Note:** The Undo/Redo capability for the *entire* project creation process is temporarily lost due to the asynchronous nature; only the DB part could potentially be undone separately.

**5. Project Rename/Delete Actions & Undo Commands:**

*   **Files Affected:** `src/slideman/ui/pages/projects_page.py`, `src/slideman/commands/rename_project.py`, `src/slideman/commands/delete_project.py`, `src/slideman/services/database.py`, `src/slideman/app_state.py`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Added "Rename Project..." and "Delete Project" `QAction`s to the `project_list_view`'s context menu. Actions are enabled/disabled based on list selection.
    *   Implemented `handle_rename_project` slot: Gets new name via `QInputDialog`. Creates `RenameProjectCmd` instance with necessary info (old/new names/paths, project ID, DB service). Pushes command to `app_state.undo_stack`. Refreshes list view.
    *   Implemented `handle_delete_project` slot: Shows `QMessageBox.question` for confirmation. Creates `DeleteProjectCmd` instance. Pushes command to undo stack. Refreshes list view.
    *   Implemented `RenameProjectCmd(QUndoCommand)`:
        *   `redo()`: Calls `os.rename` to rename the folder, then calls `db.update_project_details` (new method added to `Database`) to update DB name and path. Includes basic error handling and attempts folder rollback on DB error.
        *   `undo()`: Calls `os.rename` to rename folder back, then calls `db.update_project_details` to revert DB record.
    *   Implemented `DeleteProjectCmd(QUndoCommand)`:
        *   `redo()`: Calls `db.delete_project()`, then calls `shutil.rmtree()` to delete the folder. Logs critical error if folder delete fails after DB delete.
        *   `undo()`: Calls `db.add_project()` to restore the DB entry. **Limitation:** Does not restore the deleted folder/files.
    *   Fixed `ImportError` and `TypeError` related to `QUndoCommand` import location (`QtGui`) and type hinting (`Union`) for Python 3.9 compatibility in command classes.
    *   Fixed `AttributeError` in `ProjectsPage` by ensuring context menu actions were assigned to `self` before being accessed.
    *   Fixed `NameError` in `DeleteProjectCmd` by assigning `self.project_path` before logging it.
    *   Fixed `TypeError` related to `undoStackChanged` signal emission in `AppState` by using an intermediate slot.
*   **Architecture Alignment:** Implements user actions in the **Presentation Layer** triggering **Commands**. Commands encapsulate the operation logic and interact with the **Business Logic Layer** (`Database`, `os`, `shutil`) and **Shared State** (`AppState.undo_stack`). Follows the Command pattern for Undo/Redo.

---

**Outcome of Phase 3:** The Projects page is now functional for core project lifecycle management (Create, List, Refresh, Rename, Delete). Project creation utilizes background processing for file copying, improving UI responsiveness. Undo/Redo is implemented for Rename and Delete (with noted limitations for Delete). The application structure holds, with UI, commands, services, and state management interacting as planned. The foundation is now solid for moving into content-specific features.

# Slideman - Phase 3 Limitations & Deferred Items

While Phase 3 successfully implemented the core Projects page functionality, several items were simplified, deferred, or have known limitations that need to be considered for future development:

**1. Project Creation Undo/Redo:**

*   **Limitation:** The entire "New Project" operation (including file copying and database additions) cannot currently be undone with a single Ctrl+Z.
*   **Reason:** The file copying was moved to a background thread (`FileCopyWorker`) triggered from the UI layer (`ProjectsPage`) for responsiveness. Integrating asynchronous operations seamlessly with the synchronous nature expected by `QUndoCommand` is complex. The database additions happen in the `handle_copy_finished` slot *after* the worker completes, separate from the initial user action.
*   **Potential Future Work:**
    *   Implement a separate `AddProjectDbEntriesCmd` pushed from `handle_copy_finished`. This would allow undoing the *database* part, but would leave the copied files orphaned on the filesystem.
    *   Explore more complex command patterns that manage asynchronous operations (less standard with `QUndoStack`).
    *   Accept the current limitation for v1.0.

**2. Delete Project Undo Limitation:**

*   **Limitation:** Undoing a "Delete Project" action currently only restores the project's entry in the database. It **does not** restore the actual project folder or its contents from the filesystem (which were deleted by `shutil.rmtree`).
*   **Reason:** Reliably undoing a permanent filesystem delete is non-trivial.
*   **Potential Future Work:**
    *   Implement a "Move to Trash" mechanism instead of permanent deletion. `DeleteProjectCmd.redo()` would move the folder to a hidden trash location. `undo()` would move it back. This requires managing the trash location and potentially providing a way to empty it. This adds significant complexity.
    *   Improve the warning dialog during deletion to make the irreversibility of the file deletion clearer to the user.
    *   Refine the `DeleteProjectCmd.undo()` database logic to more robustly handle re-insertion, perhaps requiring a dedicated `undelete_project` method in the `Database` service.
    *   Accept the current limitation (DB restore only) for v1.0.

**3. Robust Folder Renaming / Path Generation:**

*   **Limitation:** The logic for generating the new folder path during rename (`RenameProjectCmd.__init__`) is basic and its handling of potential pre-existing target folders is currently just a warning. It doesn't implement the counter logic (`(2)`, `(3)`...) used during initial project creation.
*   **Reason:** Focus was on the core rename mechanism.
*   **Potential Future Work:**
    *   Refactor the folder path generation/sanitization/uniqueness logic from `ProjectsPage.handle_new_project` into a shared utility function within `services/file_io.py` or a new `utils.py`.
    *   Call this shared utility from both `handle_new_project` and `RenameProjectCmd.__init__` to ensure consistency.
    *   Implement more robust handling in `RenameProjectCmd` if the target rename folder already exists (e.g., prevent the rename and show an error, or implement counter logic).

**4. Project Storage Location:**

*   **Limitation:** The base directory for storing projects is currently hardcoded to `Documents/SlidemanProjects`.
*   **Reason:** Simplification for initial implementation.
*   **Potential Future Work:**
    *   Make the base project directory configurable via application settings (stored in `QSettings`). Add a setting dialog or an option during first run/setup.

**5. Error Handling & Cleanup during Project Creation:**

*   **Limitation:** If an error occurs *after* file copying succeeds but *during* database additions (`handle_copy_finished`), the copied files are left on disk, but the project might not be fully registered in the database, leading to an inconsistent state. Cleanup is not automatically performed.
*   **Reason:** Implementing fully transactional creation across filesystem and database is complex.
*   **Potential Future Work:**
    *   In the error handlers (`handle_copy_error`, exception block in `handle_copy_finished`), implement logic to attempt deleting the created project folder if subsequent DB operations fail. Use `shutil.rmtree` carefully with error handling.
    *   Provide clearer messages to the user about the inconsistent state if cleanup fails.

**6. UI/UX Refinements on Projects Page:**

*   **Deferred:**
    *   Displaying more project metadata in the `QListView` (e.g., date created/modified, file count, slide count - requires DB updates and model changes).
    *   Implementing the "Open Project" functionality (requires defining what "opening" means - likely loading its data into `AppState` and enabling other pages).
    *   Implementing the right-hand panel (`QStackedWidget`) properly to show project details/summary card when a project is selected, instead of just a placeholder.
    *   Using custom styled buttons (like PyDracula) for navigation instead of default `QPushButton`.
    *   Adding specific icons for all actions.

**7. Slide Conversion Trigger:**

*   **Deferred:** The actual triggering of the background slide conversion process after successful project creation (noted with a `TODO` in `handle_copy_finished`) is deferred to Phase 4.
