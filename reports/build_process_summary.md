# SLIDEMAN Build Process Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the SLIDEMAN build process as of May 5, 2025. It covers what has been completed across each development phase and what remains to be implemented to achieve a fully functional application.

SLIDEMAN is a PowerPoint library and assembly tool designed to help users manage, tag, and repurpose PowerPoint slides efficiently. The application allows users to organize PowerPoint files into projects, convert slides to images for easier viewing, apply keyword tags, and ultimately assemble new presentations from existing slides.

## Completed Work

The application has been developed through a well-structured, phase-based approach:

### Phase 1: Application Foundation

**Status: COMPLETED**

This phase established the foundational architecture and infrastructure for the application:

- **Project Structure:** Set up directory structure, version control, and dependency management
- **Environment Configuration:** Configured Poetry for dependency management with key packages (PySide6, pywin32, Pillow, etc.)
- **Resource Management:** Implemented Qt resource system for icons and stylesheets
- **Application Shell:** Created basic main window with menu bar, status bar, and theme support
- **Core Services:** Set up logging, exception handling, settings persistence
- **State Management:** Implemented AppState and EventBus singletons for centralized state and event handling
- **Theme Handling:** Basic light/dark theme switching capability

### Phase 2: Data Layer

**Status: COMPLETED**

This phase defined the core data structures and persistence layer:

- **Data Models:** Created Python dataclasses for Project, File, Slide, Element, and Keyword entities
- **Database Service:** Implemented SQLite-based database service with schema versioning
- **Schema Creation:** Set up tables, indices, and relationships for all entities
- **Project CRUD:** Implemented and tested operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting projects
- **Testing Framework:** Established unit tests for database operations

### Phase 3: Project Management UI

**Status: COMPLETED**

This phase implemented the main user interface for managing projects:

- **Projects Page:** Built UI with project list, toolbar, and placeholder for project details
- **Project List Model:** Created Qt model-view implementation for displaying projects
- **File I/O Service:** Implemented utilities for file operations, checksums, and disk space checks
- **New Project Workflow:** Added ability to create projects with file copying in background threads
- **Project Operations:** Implemented rename and delete operations with undo/redo support
- **Background Processing:** Created worker system for asynchronous file operations
- **Command Pattern:** Set up undoable commands for project management operations

### Phase 4: PowerPoint Processing

**Status: COMPLETED**

This phase added the capability to process PowerPoint files:

- **Database Enhancements:** Updated schema to track conversion status and slide paths
- **Slide Converter:** Created background worker to extract slides from PowerPoint files
- **COM Automation:** Implemented PowerPoint COM interaction to export slides as images
- **Element Extraction:** Added capability to extract shape data from slides using python-pptx
- **Progress Tracking:** Implemented UI feedback during conversion process
- **Thumbnail Generation:** Created system to generate and store thumbnails for slides
- **Thumbnail Cache:** Established foundation for caching to improve performance

## Remaining Work

Based on the completed phases and application architecture, the following work remains to be implemented:

### Phase 5: Slide Management UI

**Status: NOT STARTED**

This phase will focus on implementing the UI for viewing and managing slides:

- **Slide View Implementation:** Create a grid/gallery view to display slide thumbnails
- **Slide Details Panel:** Implement detailed view for individual slides
- **Element Visualization:** Show element bounding boxes and details
- **Thumbnail Cache Integration:** Fully integrate the thumbnail cache service
- **Slide Selection:** Enable selecting multiple slides for operations
- **Slide Filtering:** Implement filtering slides by various criteria
- **View Options:** Add different view modes (grid, list, details)

### Phase 6: Keyword System

**Status: NOT STARTED**

This phase will implement the keyword tagging functionality:

- **Keyword Management UI:** Create interface for managing the keyword library
- **Keyword Assignment:** Enable applying keywords to slides and elements
- **Keyword Database Methods:** Implement CRUD operations for keywords and associations
- **Fuzzy Matching:** Integrate rapidfuzz for intelligent keyword suggestions
- **Tag Visualization:** Display keywords visually on slides and in search
- **Batch Operations:** Allow applying keywords to multiple items at once
- **Keyword Import/Export:** Provide ways to share keywords between projects

### Phase 7: Assembly System

**STATUS: NOT STARTED**

This phase will enable creating new presentations from existing slides:

- **Assembly UI:** Implement drag-and-drop interface for slide assembly
- **Search & Filter:** Create powerful search functionality by keywords
- **Presentation Structure:** Allow organizing slides into sections
- **Preview Capability:** Provide preview of the assembled presentation
- **Export to PowerPoint:** Generate new PPTX files from selected slides
- **Assembly Templates:** Save and load assembly configurations
- **Version Tracking:** Track different versions of assemblies

### Phase 8: Final Polishing

**STATUS: NOT STARTED**

This phase will focus on final refinements and productization:

- **UI Polish:** Fine-tune the interface for consistency and aesthetics
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize for large libraries and presentations
- **Documentation:** Create user guides and help resources
- **Error Handling:** Improve error reporting and recovery
- **Installer Creation:** Package the application for distribution
- **Testing & QA:** Comprehensive testing across different environments

## Technical Debt & Known Limitations

The implementation includes some areas that have been simplified or have known limitations:

1. **Project Creation Undo/Redo:** Currently cannot undo the entire project creation process due to asynchronous file operations
2. **Delete Project Undo Limitation:** Undoing a delete only restores database entries, not deleted files
3. **Project Storage Location:** Hardcoded to Documents/SlidemanProjects without configuration option
4. **Limited Error Recovery:** Incomplete cleanup in case of partial operation failures
5. **Thread-Safety Concerns:** Potential for race conditions in certain database operations
6. **COM Automation Dependency:** Requires PowerPoint to be installed for conversion to work
7. **Limited Platform Support:** Primary focus on Windows due to COM dependency

## Conclusion

SLIDEMAN has completed 4 out of 8 planned development phases. The foundation, data layer, project management UI, and PowerPoint processing capabilities are in place. The remaining work focuses on slide management, keyword systems, assembly functionality, and final polishing.

The application follows a clean layered architecture with good separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and persistence layers. The use of background processing, command pattern for undo/redo, and event-driven communication demonstrates a robust software design that should make the remaining implementation phases more straightforward.
